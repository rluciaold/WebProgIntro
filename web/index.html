        <h1>Lesson 01: Using Wiggle</h1>

    Sometimes you need to lose control. Using the Wiggle expression in
    AfterEffects will grant you the power to add and tweak randomness to any
    editable option, anywhere. In the following examples, I used a very simple
    setup. A grey wood texture as a 3D layer for the background, a camera to
    look at it, and a spot light. Wiggle can be used to add randomness to
    anything that allows an expression to be written, such as position,
    rotation, scale, brightness, hue, etc. In the following examples, I used
    wiggle to add randomness to the light's "Point of Interest", which is the
    point in which the light is aiming.

    First, you need to know how to apply an expression to an objects property. After you create objects, Alt+Click on the stopwatch button of the property you wish to apply an expression to.

    You will open up an expression box in which you can write a vast amount of different expressions. Feel free to delete what's already written in that box.

    In this example, we've written a subtle and simple wiggle expression. To finalize and complete the writing of this expression, don't press Enter like you may feel like doing, but just click away from the text box. Below, we'll explore the format of the wiggle expression and what the end product looks like!

    We need to understand the basic format of the wiggle expression:
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
    wiggle(a,b)
    The term wiggle tells AfterEffects that the wiggle function is going to be used.

    The a & b are to be replaced by numbers. a represents the number of times per second it 'wiggles' and b represents the amount to wiggle.

    For example: 
    </p>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/IMKf379.gif">

    <p class="imgtag">
    expression 1: wiggle(2,5)
    </p>

    <p>Look closely at the above image. It's an animated .GIF, that light is actually moving very slightly. That's because the expression used to create that particular wiggle used very small numbers.
    </p>

    <p class="indented">
    wiggle(2,5)
    <br>
    2 times per second it moved 5 pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
    This may be useful when you want to add very subtle movement, randomness, or imperfection to an item's qualities. One very useful application would to be to add this subtle wiggle to a camera to give it a less robotic feel and give it a more organic vibe-- a little bit of wiggle goes a long way.

    <p class="imgtag">
    expression 2: wiggle(2,500)
    </p>

    <p>
    Now it's a bit more obvious what's happening here. 2 times per second, or every half second, the Point of Interest of the light changes up to 500 pixels. It's random-- so one change might be 323 pixels, the next may be 20 pixels, the next could be -460 pixels, and so on.

    <p class="imgtag">
    expression 3: wiggle(2,5000)
    </p>

    <p>
    The above example shows what it would look like if you went a bit more extreme with the formula. No applications for such a drastic expression immediately come to mind, but it's important to know your options.

    expression 4: wiggle(5,50)
    </p>

    <p>
    This expression is a little different. Now, I've changed the first variable instead of the second. It's now changing 5 times per second, at a range of 50 pixels.
    </p>

    <p class="imgtag">
    expression 5: wiggle(10,50)
    </p>

    <p>
    This is the same change-range of 50 pixels, but now with a doubled 10 times per second. It's starting to look a bit 'shakier'. Be aware that in these examples they are only running at 30 frames per second.

    <p class="imgtag">
    expression 6: wiggle(50,50)
    </p>

    <p>
    This expression is wiggling 50 times per second at a range of 50 pixels. It looks extremely unstable. It's actually changing it's range/destination of within 50 pixels faster than it is displaying each frame! Of course, AfterEffects forces the animation to display at our configured 30 FPS, and we see just that. However, AfterEffects is still processing the effect at 50 times per second, which means the output will be visibly different.

    <p class="imgtag">
    expression 7: wiggle(20,200)
    </p>

    <p>
    This example has both variables quite high. 20 times per second it changes within a range of 200 pixels.

    It's important to look at these animations and appreciate them for what they really are.  Zero keyframes were made in all of these animations. All I did was write a simple wiggle expression for each. This saves an amazing amount of     time, as keyframing is obviously a very time consuming manual process.
